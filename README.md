#project twenty_or_so

objective: this is a virtual version of the classic twenty_or_so questions game.

functionality:
              
              -this is a virtual remake of the twenty questions game, where the cpu would guess what the user is thinking about in about 20 yes/no questions.

              -the questions for now have been limited to guess the vegetable / fruit the user is thinking.
             
              -to make this possible, use of binary search tree has been done.
              
              -in the BST, the leaf nodes contain names of the vegetable/fruit while the inner nodes contain the questions
              
              -the code for the BST working is in (bst.c) while the main game code is in (twenty.c)
              
              -the header file (bst.h)


language: C
